#Introduction:

Nowadays, every technical field is trying to style human life at ease. With the rapid growth in the use of the internet and the technologies associated with it, several opportunities are coming up in the web or mobile application. This is made possible through the use of an electronic payment system. It is possible for everyone to order any goods from anywhere on the internet and have the goods delivered to his/her home. Basically, ''Food Ordering System" can be defined as: 

A simple and convenient way for the customers to purchase food online, without having to go to the restaurant. 

This system is very useful to those who are very busy at work or in-home and do not have the time to go outside or cook food. Customers don't really need to have the technical knowledge to operate it. Because it is designed in a very modest way.  

Therefore, as per this system, the customer visits the restaurant's app or website, browses through the various food items available there, and goes ahead and selects and purchases the items he or she needs. These items will then be delivered to the customer at his or her doorstep. Payments for such online orders can be made through debit cards, cash on delivery. 

In short, it's easy, convenient, completely transparent software and a customer-friendly food ordering system. 

The system will become an important tool for a restaurant to improve the management aspect. This can be done by the use of a computer system to connect each and every transaction instead of manually recording data on it. It can assist the user to concentrate on their other activities rather than concentrate on record keeping. Thus, it will help the organization in better utilization of resources.

 #Project Design: 

In this phase, a logical system is built which fulfils the given requirements. The design phase of software development deals with transforming the customer's requirements into a logically working system. Normally, design is performed in the following two steps: 

1. Primary Design Phase: 

In this phase, the system is designed at the block level. The blocks are created based on analysis done in the problem identification phase. Different blocks are created for different functions emphasis is put on minimizing the information flow between blocks. Thus, all activities which require more interaction are kept in one block.

2. Secondary Design Phase: 

In the second phase, the detailed design of every block is performed. 

General tasks involved in the project design process are following: 
Design various blocks for overall system processes. Design smaller, compact, and workable modules in each block. Design various database structures. Specify details of programs to achieve the desired functionality. Design the form of inputs and outputs of the system. Perform documentation of the design. System reviews. 

 

 User Interface Design: 

User Interface Design is concerned with the dialogue between a user and the computer. It is concerned with everything from starting the system or logging into the system to the eventual presentation of desired inputs and outputs. The overall flow of screens and messages is called a dialogue. 

The following steps are guidelines for User Interface Design: 
The system user should always be aware of what to do next. The screen should be formatted so that various types of information, instructions, and messages always appear in the same general display area. Message, instructions, or information should be displayed long enough to allow the system user to read them.  Use display attributes sparingly. Default values for fields and answers to be entered by the user should be specified. A user should not be allowed to proceed without correcting an error. The system user should never get an operating system message or fatal error.
